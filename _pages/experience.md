- ðŸ§¬ ***Graduate Researcher* @ [Medical Imaging Informatics](https://mii.ucla.edu) (September 2021 - Present)**
  -  Currently developing a context-sensitive knowledge graph for non-small cell lung carcinoma through data mining and ProtÃ©gÃ©, optimized through constraints and queryable through a user interface using JavaScript.

- ðŸ§¬ ***Data Science Intern* @ [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com) (June 2021 - August 2021)**
  -  Implemented NLP pipelines with deep learning models from Spark NLP and custom heuristics to extract relevant entities from biomedical corpuses to facilitate the clinical trial enrollment pipeline, improving performance across all metrics by 25% for gene and mutation extractions.
  - Classified drug efficacy based on biomedical texts with 97% accuracy using Scikit-learn.

- :rocket: ***Research Intern* @ [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov) (November 2020 - May 2021)**
  - Worked on object detection using deep learning with CARLA, YOLO/SSD for advanced driver assistance systems for first responders.
  - Conducted feasibility tests with different datasets and models to improve performance.

- :robot: ***Undergraduate Researcher* @ [Advanced Robotic Eye Surgery Lab](https://www.uclahealth.org/eye/center-for-advanced-robotic-eye-surgery) (August 2019 - November 2020)**
  - Implemented traditional image segmentation algorithms in MATLAB to process OCT scans and segment different layers of the retina.

- :eye: ***Undergraduate Researcher* @ [Ocular Motility Lab](https://www.uclahealth.org/joseph-demer) (October 2018 - September 2020)**
  - Implemented a U-Net using â€‹Tensorflowâ€‹ and â€‹Kerasâ€‹ to automatically segment OCT blood vessels to facilitate the identification of optic neuropathy biomarkers.
  - Collaborated with graduate students, international clinical fellows, and expert physicians on research projects resulting in poster presentations and 5+ publications, including 2 first-authored papers.
  - Presented research at the 2019 UCLA Undergraduate Research Poster day and was accepted into the annual Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) conference.
