I am currently a senior at UCLA studying Computational & Systems Biology (Data Science Concentration). My research interests lie broadly in biomedical informatics and deep learning. I have previously conducted research in two bioengineering labs where I became closely familiar with clinical processes and medical imaging studies. After a year of doing computer vision research at NASA JPL exploring methods to better detect vehicles to improve first responder safety, I am currently doing NLP research with biomedical corpuses for the summer at Illumina. I am also the design director for the Society of Women Engineers @ UCLA, where I advocate for accessibility and cohesiveness in branding. If I'm not working, I'm probably on a mountain or at IKEA.
