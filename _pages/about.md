I am currently a senior at UCLA studying Computational & Systems Biology, and my research interests lie broadly in biomedical informatics and deep learning. Previously, I have conducted research in two bioengineering labs where I became familiar with clinical processes and medical imaging studies. After a year of doing research at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory exploring object detection methods for first responder safety, I am now doing NLP research with biomedical corpuses for the summer at Illumina. I also serve as the design director for the Society of Women Engineers @ UCLA, where I advocate for accessibility and cohesiveness in branding. If I'm not working, I'm probably on a mountain or at IKEA.
