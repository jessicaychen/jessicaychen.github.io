I am a senior at UCLA studying Computational & Systems Biology while concurrently completing my Master's in Bioinformatics (expected grad Spring 2022), and my research interests lie broadly in biomedical informatics and deep learning. Previously, I conducted research in two bioengineering labs where I became familiar with clinical processes and medical imaging studies. After a year of working at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov) exploring object detection methods for first responder safety, I worked on facilitating the clinical trial enrollment pipeline through biomedical NLP research for the summer at [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com). I also serve as the design director for the [Society of Women Engineers @ UCLA](https://www.swe.ucla.edu), where I advocate for accessibility and cohesiveness in branding. If I'm not working, I'm probably on a mountain or at IKEA. :relaxed:

I am currently on the job market starting June 2022!
